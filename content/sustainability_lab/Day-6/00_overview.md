# Sustainability Lab: Day 6+ – Ongoing Challenges

After the first five days, keep the momentum going. Curate new tasks based on what interests you, or pull ideas from a shared task board:

- Build a library or community pool
- Design pirate ships or rocket ships
- Create mini-games, arcade competitions, or even an Olympic arena

Encourage students to play each other's mini-games and continue expanding their sustainable world.

## Beyond the Basics

Continue world-building with advanced topics:

- **Languages** – invent unique ways for your people to communicate. Try out conlangs like Klingon or Na'vi.
- **Youth Justice** – explore how young villagers might be treated differently than adults, and design restorative practices instead of punitive ones.

### Real-World Inspiration

Connect your creations with real issues like Fairtrade farming, sustainable fashion, and concepts from *Doughnut Economics*. These themes can inspire quests and challenges in your Minecraft storyworld.
