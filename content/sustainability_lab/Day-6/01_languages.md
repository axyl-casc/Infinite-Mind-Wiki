# Invent Languages

Create unique ways for your villagers to communicate. Experiment with conlangs like Klingon or Na'vi.

Since this is a Minecraft-scale version of Earth, you also have the opportunity to look into the real-world history and cultures of the region where you placed your village. Students may choose to explore Indigenous or local languages from that area, and bring attention to the stories, resilience, and linguistic traditions of Aboriginal or historically marginalized peoples connected to that land. This can be a chance to reflect on the power of language in shaping identity and belonging, while supporting reconciliation through education.
