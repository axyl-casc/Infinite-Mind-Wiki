# Day 6+ ‚Äì Ongoing Challenges

Keep the momentum going by creating new tasks or pulling ideas from a shared board. Build libraries, pirate ships, rocket ships‚Äîanything that expands your world. Encourage classmates to post optional challenges like roller coasters, mini games, or Olympic-style events. The goal is a student-driven community that keeps growing after day five.

Consider adding community traditions:

- Choose a **Flower of the Realm** to represent your home.
- Write an **anthem** and note the musical key.
- Decide if education is a **standardized** curriculum or **mentor system**.
- Choreograph a **dance of the Community Village**.
- Plan a **regenerative soil** strategy for farming.
- Establish **sustainable water and waste** systems.
- Draft protocols for **welcoming foreign dignitaries**.
