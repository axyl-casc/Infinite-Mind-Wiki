# Tidal Power 🐋

Tidal energy harnesses the rise and fall of ocean tides to generate electricity. In Minecraft, you can simulate tidal power with alternating water levels and redstone machines.

## Build Ideas
- Build a piston-driven gate that opens and closes with the tide
- Create underwater turbines or water wheels

## Real-World Connection
Tidal power is a predictable form of sustainable energy that works best in coastal areas with strong tidal currents.
