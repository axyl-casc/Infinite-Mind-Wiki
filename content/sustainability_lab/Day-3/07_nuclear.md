# Nuclear Power ⚛️

Nuclear energy is produced by splitting atoms in a process called fission. It generates a large amount of electricity with very low carbon emissions. While not technically renewable, it's often included in sustainable energy discussions due to its efficiency.

## Build Ideas
- Create a secure power plant with control rooms and cooling towers
- Use iron blocks, redstone, and brewing stands to represent the reactor core
- Build a containment chamber and simulate fuel rods with unique materials

## Real-World Connection
Nuclear power is a powerful low-emission energy source but requires careful waste management and safety protocols. It's widely used around the world to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
