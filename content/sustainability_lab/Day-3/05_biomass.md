# Biomass 🌱

Biomass energy is produced by burning organic materials like plants, wood, or food waste. In Minecraft, you can represent biomass with composters, furnaces, or farms that generate fuel.

## Build Ideas
- Set up a farm that supplies a composter or furnace system
- Create a biomass plant that turns crops or wood into burnable fuel
- Use hoppers, droppers, and redstone to automate your biomass conversion

## Real-World Connection
Biomass is a sustainable resource as long as plants are regrown. It's widely used in rural areas and can help manage waste while producing energy.
