# Sustainability Lab: Day 3 â€“ Renewable Energy

It's time to move beyond redstone torches. Design and implement a new source of renewable power for your village.

Possible options include solar arrays, windmills, or other creative methods that fit within Minecraft.

## Story Time

Write a brief backstory for your village. What environmental catastrophe related to your chosen energy source forced the survivors to settle here? Share your ideas with the class.
