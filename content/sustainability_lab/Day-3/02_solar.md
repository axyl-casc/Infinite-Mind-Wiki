# Solar Power ☀️

Solar energy comes from the sun and can be turned into electricity using solar panels. In Minecraft, you can simulate solar power using daylight sensors, redstone lamps, and pistons or observers.

## Build Ideas
- Place daylight sensors to activate lights or machines during the day
- Use redstone circuits to store energy in the form of piston-activated mechanisms
- Create solar panel fields on rooftops or in open areas

## Real-World Connection
Solar power is one of the cleanest sources of sustainable energy. It reduces the need for fossil fuels and works best in sunny regions.
