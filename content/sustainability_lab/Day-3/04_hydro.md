# Hydropower 🌊

Hydropower uses the force of moving water—like rivers or waterfalls—to generate electricity. In Minecraft, you can simulate this using flowing water, water wheels, and redstone components.

## Build Ideas
- Design a dam with a redstone-powered control gate
- Build a water wheel that “spins” using decorative blocks and pistons
- Use water flow to activate redstone contraptions downstream

## Real-World Connection
Hydropower is a reliable and sustainable energy source that doesn’t produce pollution. It’s often used in mountainous or river-filled regions.
