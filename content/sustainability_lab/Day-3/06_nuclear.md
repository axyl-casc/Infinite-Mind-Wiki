# Nuclear Fusion ‚öõÔ∏è

Nuclear **fusion** is a cutting-edge process that powers the sun and stars. Unlike fission, which splits atoms, fusion combines light atoms (like hydrogen) into heavier ones (like helium), releasing an enormous amount of energy in the process. It produces no carbon emissions and generates far less radioactive waste, making it a promising sustainable energy source for the future.

## Build Ideas

- Construct a futuristic fusion research lab or tokamak reactor (use quartz, glass, and beacon beams)  
- Use amethyst blocks or end rods to represent plasma containment and magnetic fields  
- Simulate control systems with redstone circuits and comparators


## Real-World Connection

Fusion energy is not yet widespread, but scientists around the world are racing to make it a reality. Projects like [ITER](https://www.iter.org/) aim to create stable fusion reactions that produce more energy than they consume. If successful, fusion could provide abundant energy with minimal environmental impact.
