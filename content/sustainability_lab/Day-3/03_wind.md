# Wind Power üå¨Ô∏è

Wind energy is created by the movement of air and can be converted into electricity using wind turbines. In Minecraft, you can represent wind power with tall spinning structures made of blocks and animated with redstone.

## Build Ideas
- Build tall windmills with rotating blades using pistons or command blocks
- Create decorative spinning turbines to simulate energy generation
- Use observers and redstone to simulate movement or activation by wind

## Real-World Connection
Wind power is a clean and sustainable energy source. It works well in open, windy areas and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
