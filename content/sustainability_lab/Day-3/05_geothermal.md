# Geothermal 🌋

Geothermal energy comes from the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It's used to generate electricity or provide direct heating. In Minecraft, you can represent geothermal power with lava, magma blocks, and underground bases.

## Build Ideas
- Create an underground energy plant powered by lava pools
- Use magma blocks and redstone to simulate heat-based activation
- Build tunnels with steam vents and piping to mimic heat transfer

## Real-World Connection
Geothermal energy is constant and clean, especially effective in volcanic areas. It's a powerful sustainable source that doesn't rely on weather conditions.
