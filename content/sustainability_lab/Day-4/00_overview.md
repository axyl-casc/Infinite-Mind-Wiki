# Sustainability Lab: Day 4 â€“ Build a Market

Create a shop or market for your village. Use banners and signs to explain what you sell. Banners should showcase colorful designs (avoid black and white) and demonstrate concepts from the color wheel.

- Establish your own exchange rates (e.g. food for gold).
- Design a large, eye-catching shop in a separate shared world where everyone can explore each other's creations.

## The Protagonist

Think about how the past catastrophe impacted one main character in your village. What is their goal now? This adds depth to the story behind your sustainable market.
