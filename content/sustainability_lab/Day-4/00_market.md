# Build a Market

**"T" is for Trade Fair.** Design banners to represent your sustainable village and trade goods or prosocial services with fellow players. You can even explore youth justice themes while discovering "Doughnut Economics"—a sprinkle doughnut seeking balance between the ecological ceiling and social equity.

Create a shop or market for your village. Use banners and signs with colorful designs (avoid black and white) to explain what you sell. Try complementary colors from the wheel when designing your flag or banner. Establish exchange rates like trading food for gold, and showcase your shop in the shared market world.

Ready for more flair? Host a sustainable fashion show in the Nether or End where skin designers strut their creations down a "catwalk".
