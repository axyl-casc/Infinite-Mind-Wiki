Welcome to the **Sustainability Lab**, a hands-on series of Minecraft challenges focused on sustainable energy and collaborative play. The course begins with an orientation tour of an existing sustainable village. You'll pick a sustainable energy source, teleport to a biome, and choose a special animal to join your adventure.
