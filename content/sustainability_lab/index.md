Welcome to the **Sustainability Lab**, a hands-on series of Minecraft challenges focused on sustainable energy and collaborative play. The course begins with an orientation tour of an existing sustainable village. You'll pick a sustainable energy source, teleport to a biome, and choose a special animal to join your adventure.

The **Sustainability Summer Camp** is a fiveâ€‘day journey where each day highlights a letter from **EARTH**. Ready to begin your adventure as an EARTH Knight through the lens of sustainability? Let's get started!

### ðŸŒ± The E.A.R.T.H. Journey

Step into the role of an **E.A.R.T.H. Knight** and explore a Minecraft world shaped by story, sustainability, and collective action. Each day blends storytelling, survival, creativity, and celebration. Click below to jump into each immersive experience:

* [**Day 1 â€“ E is for Empathize: Getting Started**](/sustainability_lab/Day-1/00_getting_started)
  Meet *Sam the Enderman* in a climate cautionary tale. Then, in Creative Mode, build a shelter for your Knight and animal companion â€” both fleeing a disaster. Begin your quest by practicing empathy through story.

* [**Day 2 â€“ A is for Adventure: Disaster Prep**](/sustainability_lab/Day-2/00_intro)
  Enter Adventure Mode and prepare for survival! Construct a bunker focused on hydration, nutrition, and protection. Navigate a new challenge and test your real-life skills in a Minecraft emergency.

* [**Day 3 â€“ R is for Renewables: Sustainable Energy**](/sustainability_lab/Day-3/00_intro)
  Use Creative Mode to build clean energy systems with Redstone or decorative elements. Design with purpose as you explore the logic and justice behind renewable power.

* [**Day 4 â€“ T is for Trade Fair: Market Day**](/sustainability_lab/Day-4/00_market)
  Join a village marketplace where trading, banners, and fair exchanges take center stage. Discover how Doughnut Economics helps balance social equity and ecological limits.

  Celebrate your week of learning! Create a storyboard of your adventure and earn a personal certificate. Reflect, dance, and share in the joy of community-led sustainability.

* [**Day 6+ â€“ Ongoing Challenges**](/sustainability_lab/Day-6/00_ongoing_challenges)
  Ready for more? Take on bonus missions in storytelling, youth justice, language, and Indigenous knowledge. Keep your world growing and become a mentor for future EARTH Knights.


Youâ€™ll take on the mantle of an **EARTH Knight**, learning to listen, build, and lead in community.


Beyond these core days, additional classes dive into storytelling, languages, youth justice, and real-world sustainability topics. Use them to expand your Minecraft world and connect with other students in future adventures.

We believe learning should be inclusive, joyful, and co-created. Extra missions explore stories, languages, climate justice, and Indigenous ways of knowing â€” giving you the chance to expand your Minecraft world and become a mentor to others.

Letâ€™s build a future where kindness, creativity, and equity guide the game. ðŸŒ±
