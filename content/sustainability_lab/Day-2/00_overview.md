# Sustainability Lab: Day 2 â€“ Disaster Preparation

Review yesterday's tasks with your instructor. Once all signs are green, clear the board and prepare for new challenges.

## New Tasks

1. **Plan for your chosen natural disaster.** Ideas include:
   - Tornado
   - Tsunami
   - Earthquake
   - Flood
2. **Build an alarm system** for your town using bells or a redstone mechanism to flash lights and warn citizens.

3. **Conceptualize your renewable energy source**. Sketch out how you'll represent it with redstone contraptions. Will you build wind turbines with spinning blades or solar panels that light up?
