# Sustainability Lab: Day 2 – Disaster Preparation

**"A" is for Adventure.** Use a short window in creative mode to build a bunker before switching to adventure mode. Can you survive a new disaster—or even a zombie invasion? Bunker creation introduces life skills like hydration, nutrition, and self-defense.

Make sure all Day 1 tasks are green on your board. Once your instructor checks them off, clear yesterday's board and start fresh. Today we prepare for natural disasters and plan a sustainable power source.

Sketch a bunker—or even a full escape room—to ride out future calamities. Think about community defenses and how you'll keep order if danger strikes.

Confirm **one** of the disasters to prepare for:
