# Choose Your Animal

Pick a special animal companion for your adventure. You will need to build a small shelter or habitat that fits its natural environment later.

But this isn’t just about choosing a pet—it’s about understanding their story. How did they evolve? Why do they live the way they do? What do they need to survive?

To truly befriend your animal, you must walk in their footsteps. Use their evolutionary background to inspire your village design and the role they play in your community.

Imagine your bond like an alliance from a fantasy world—dwarves and elves, once separate, now learning to live together. You and your animal must find that balance.

### Speak "friend" and enter.
