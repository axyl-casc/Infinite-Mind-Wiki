# Sustainability Lab: Day 1 – Getting Started

Welcome to the Sustainability Lab! We begin with an **orientation tour** of an
existing sustainable village. Each student selects a renewable energy source
(like solar or wind), chooses a biome to teleport to, and picks a special animal
to care for. New students joining later receive this tour on their first day so
they can quickly catch up while everyone else continues building.

## Main Tasks

1. **Choose an animal**, a natural disaster to prepare for, and a location in the world to take shelter.
2. **Create a task board** in the town square. Use colored signs to track progress:
   - **Red** – not completed
   - **Orange** – in progress
   - **Green** – complete
   - **Purple** – need instructor help
3. Each student sets up their own board with the four key tasks:
   - Secure a **water source**
   - Establish a **sustainable food source**
   - Build a **basic survival shelter**
   - Make a **home for your chosen animal**
4. Optional subtasks include **building paths**, a **fountain**, or any creative touch that makes the area feel like home.
