**The Story of Sam the Enderman**

Long ago, before humanity ever carved steel into the sky, the planet Venus was ruled by ancient beings: the Endermen and their dragon overlords. Wrapped in toxic clouds and smothering heat, Venus was perfect—a sweltering greenhouse world that nourished their dark, otherworldly biology.

Among them was Sam, a strategist and manipulator, coldly brilliant and fiercely loyal to his kind. While others waited, Sam acted. He saw opportunity beyond Venus, in the vulnerable blue world nearby—Earth.

When Venus began to collapse under violent solar storms, Sam led the exodus. The dragons went dormant, but Endermen scouts—handpicked by Sam—spread across the stars. Earth was their prize. But its air was thin, its climate mild—unsuitable for their kind. Sam’s mission was clear: terraform it from the shadows.

Quietly, his team infiltrated. They whispered into the minds of inventors, fueled humanity’s obsession with industry, and encouraged the unchecked burning of fossil fuels. With each passing year, Earth grew hotter, stormier—more like Venus.

Sam did not pity the humans. He watched them suffer, scatter, drown—and called it progress. Forests burned, glaciers fell, and sea levels rose. Sam only smiled.

But some humans began to resist. They embraced renewable energy, fought to cut emissions, and saw through the industrial illusion Sam had conjured. Their resistance was small—but growing.

Now, Sam is no longer hiding. He is accelerating his plans, unleashing chaos disguised as advancement. The more Earth burns, the closer it comes to becoming his second Venus.

We must act. Not to reason with Sam, but to stop him.

This is no longer just a fight for Earth’s climate—it is a battle for survival against an ancient enemy who thrives in our downfall.

**Will you rise against Sam the Enderman?**
