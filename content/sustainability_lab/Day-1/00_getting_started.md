# Sustainability Lab: Day 1 – Getting Started

**"E" is for Empathize.** Students are immersed in the StoryWorld of [Sam the Enderman](/sustainability_lab/Day-1/sam_the_enderman)—a dimension ravaged by climate change. Jump into creative mode and build a shelter for your EARTH Knight protagonist and their special animal companion who have fled a disaster. This opening activity teaches empathy for the hero you'll guide through the rest of camp.

Begin with an **orientation tour** of an existing sustainable village. Pick a sustainable energy source, teleport to a biome, and see how students before you built their towns. New arrivals get this tour on their first day so they can join ongoing builds.

### Community Village Setup

Start recording the basics of your settlement:

- **Village name and biome**
- **Village coordinates**
- **Disaster you fled and the animal companion that came with you**
- **Ideas for floating homes or other evolved dwellings**

Keep these details handy—they will guide the tasks on later days.
