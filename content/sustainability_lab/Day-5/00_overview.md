# Sustainability Lab: Day 5 â€“ Community Government

With villages thriving, design a system of government. Discuss options like **consensus**, **monarchy**, **majority rule**, or even **anarchy**. Use your animals to vote on laws by guiding them along a **green** path for "yes" or **red** path for "no".

- Ask questions like *"Should robbers be sent to prison?"*
- Each student writes a book with proposed laws and discusses them with peers.
- Create a mini-game to handle voting and let the animals decide!
