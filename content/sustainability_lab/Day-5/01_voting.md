# Voting Mini-Game

Use your animals to vote on laws. Guide them down a **green** path for "yes" or a **red** path for "no".

# Questions:

### Governance

* Should the village make decisions by consensus (everyone must agree)?
* Should a single leader (monarch) make final decisions?
* Should decisions be made by majority vote?
* Should there be no formal rules (anarchy)?

### Lifestyle

* Should the village be nomadic, moving often instead of settling permanently?
* Should the village be stationary, building permanent homes and farms?

### Borders & Joining

* Should the village have open borders, where anyone can join freely?
* Should the village have closed borders, with no newcomers allowed?
* Should new people be asked to show survival skills (hunting, farming, crafting)?
* Should new people be asked to show social skills (teamwork, problem solving)?

### Justice & Youth

* Should youth who break rules be punished (e.g., chores, restrictions)?
* Should youth justice focus on fixing mistakes (e.g., making amends, apologies)?
* Should the system mix both punishment and restoration?

### Trade & Economy

* Should the village produce goods for export to outsiders?
* Should the village import resources it cannot make itself?
* Should trade happen mainly by land (caravans, roads)?
* Should trade happen mainly by water (boats, rivers, lakes)?
