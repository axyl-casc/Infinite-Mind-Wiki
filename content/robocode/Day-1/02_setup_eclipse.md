# Set Up Java with Eclipse

If you prefer to use **Eclipse IDE**, follow these steps to get Java running locally.

## Install Eclipse and JDK

1. Download the [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Install the latest **Java Development Kit (JDK 21+)** if it isn't already installed.
3. Launch Eclipse and select a workspace location you can easily find.

## Create a New Project

1. Choose **File → New → Java Project**.
2. Name the project `RobocodeLab` and click **Finish**.
3. Right‑click the project and create a **src** folder if it isn't already there.

## Verify Installation

Create a file `HelloWorld.java` inside `src` and paste the simple example from the next lesson. Run it with **Run → Java Application** to confirm everything works.
