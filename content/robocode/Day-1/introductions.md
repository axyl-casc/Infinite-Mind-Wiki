Welcome to Day 1 of our programming camp! Before we dive into code, let’s take a few minutes to get to know each other.

---

### 🔗 What to Do

When it’s your turn, please share:

1. Your **name**
2. What you **enjoy about programming**
3. One **fun fact** about you (optional)

You can:

* Turn on your mic and speak aloud, **or**
* Post your answers in the chat

There’s no right or wrong way to do it—we’re just here to connect and start camp as a team!

### ✅ Example

Hi! I’m **Sam**. I like programming because it feels like building little machines with my brain. A fun fact about me is that I once made a website entirely about penguins!

---

### 🚀 Why We’re Doing This

* Everyone gets a chance to say hello
* We learn what inspires our fellow coders
* It helps us feel more connected from the start

---

We’ll go one by one, or you can volunteer if you’d like to go first. Let’s begin!
