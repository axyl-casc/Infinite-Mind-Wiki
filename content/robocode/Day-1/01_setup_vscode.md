## 🔌 Step 1: Get Your Tools

1. 🖥️ [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.
2. ☕ Install the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** — version 21 or later is perfect.
3. 🧩 Open VS Code and grab the **Extension Pack for Java** from the Extensions panel — it’s like adding mods to make your coding life easier!

## 📂 Step 2: Open Your Robot Lab

1. Open your `RobocodeLab` folder (unzip it if needed).
2. Inside VS Code, go to **File → Open Folder...** and choose your `RobocodeLab` folder.
3. Navigate to the `src` folder — this is where your Java magic will live!

## ✅ Step 3: Prep for First Program
