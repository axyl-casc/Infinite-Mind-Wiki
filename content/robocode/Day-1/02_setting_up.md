# Robocode Lab: Day 1 ‚Äì Setting Up Robocode

Before we start programming robots, let's make sure your environment is ready.

## Step 1: Download the Starter Pack

Download the ZIP file [from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i6FZac8pu5t5NaLergF418TffxZa45ST/view?usp=drive_link) provided by your instructor. It contains everything you need to begin:

- Robocode application
- A workspace folder
- A starter Java robot template
