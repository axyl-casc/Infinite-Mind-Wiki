# Robocode Lab: Day 1 ‚Äì Setting Up Robocode

Before we start programming robots, let's make sure your environment is ready.

## Step 1: Download the Starter Pack

Download the ZIP file [from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ebKEZ2cWdQoog77BaIlyOVg-u_DIJsQ/view?usp=sharing) provided by your instructor. It contains everything you need to begin:

- Robocode application
- A workspace folder
- A starter Java robot template

> üì¶ If you haven't received the ZIP, ask your instructor or team lead.

## Step 2: Extract and Open the Project

1. Unzip the folder to your desktop.
   - **Windows:** right-click and choose **Extract All...**
   - **macOS:** double-click the zip file to extract.
2. Inside, you'll see a folder named `RoboCode`.
3. Open your VS Code.
4. Use **File ‚Üí Open Folder** and select the `RoboCode/robots/MyFirstRobot` directory on your desktop.

## Step 3: Verify the Setup
