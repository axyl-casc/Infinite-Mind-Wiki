# Your First Java Program

After installing Java and setting up your editor, test the environment with a simple program.

## Create `HelloWorld.java`

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Compile and run it from your terminal:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

You should see the text `Hello, world!` printed in the terminal. Once this works, you're ready to dive into Robocode.
