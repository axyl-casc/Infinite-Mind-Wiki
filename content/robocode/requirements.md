* **Audio Setup**: A working microphone and speaker (or headset) setup is necessary for participating in discussions, asking questions, and receiving instruction during live sessions.

* **Software Installation Capability**: Students must be able to download and install software such as Robocode Tank Royale, Visual Studio Code and Java.
* **Paper and Pencil**: Helpful for sketching strategies, taking notes, or solving problems by hand.
* **Age Range**: This course is designed for students aged 10 to 14. Prior programming experience is not required, though familiarity with object-oriented programming languages (e.g., Python, C++, or JavaScript) can be helpful.
* **Parent or Guardian Support**: Especially for younger students, having an adult available to assist with installation and setup is recommended. (First day only)
