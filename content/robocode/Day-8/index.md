## Lesson Requirements

* Have your improved robot from **Day 7** ready to modify
* Keep a notebook or whiteboard nearby for planning

## Lesson Outcomes

* Sketch out a full strategy using UML or flowcharts
* Brainstorm movement and survival tactics
* Refactor existing code to implement your new plan

> Day 8 is all about **Strategy Design**. Grab pen and paper to sketch ideas before jumping back into code.

## Agenda

- **Plan robot behavior with UML** diagrams. Map out states and transitions.
- **Brainstorm survival strategies** beyond attacking. Think energy management, dodging, and situational awareness.
- **Refactor your robot** for cleaner performance using helper methods and clear naming.

We focus on design first so your next code iteration is intentional and efficient.
