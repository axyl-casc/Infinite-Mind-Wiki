> Survival first! Use these ideas to keep your robot alive longer than your opponents.

# Brainstorming Tactics

- **Energy Awareness** – fire smaller bullets when low on power to stay in the fight.
- **Constant Motion** – avoid becoming an easy target by always moving.
- **Perpendicular Turning** – when scanned or hit, turn 90° to incoming fire.
- **Wall Smoothing** – adjust movement near the arena walls to prevent getting stuck.
- **Random Dodge** – mix up your movement patterns so enemies can't predict you.

Sketch these options out on paper to visualize how your tank flows between them.
