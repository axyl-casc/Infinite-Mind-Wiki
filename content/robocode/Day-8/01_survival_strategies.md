> 🛡️ Survival First! Outsmart and Outlast

Your goal in Robocode isn’t just to win with brute force — it’s to survive longer than everyone else. Think like a strategist, not just a shooter.

# 🔍 Brainstorming Tactics

Here are some smart moves to stay alive longer:

* **💡 Energy Awareness** – Fire smaller bullets (low power) when your energy is low. Don’t run out of juice while trying to get a knockout.
* **🏃 Constant Motion** – Never stop moving. A stationary tank is a vulnerable target.
* **↪️ Perpendicular Turning** – When you're scanned or hit, turn 90° to the opponent. It helps you dodge future shots.
* **🧱 Wall Smoothing** – Near the edges of the arena, curve your path slightly to avoid getting trapped.
* **🎲 Random Dodge** – Mix up your movements with random speeds and turns so opponents can't predict you.

✏️ **Your Task:** Draw these tactics as a flowchart or decision tree. Sketch on paper how your robot might switch between them depending on the situation.

# 🔍 Robot Research

In your project folder, look inside `Robocode/robots`.

You’ll find `.java` files for many robots. These files are:

* **Well-documented** – with helpful comments explaining what each part does
* **Tactic-rich** – showing real strategies like movement styles, radar locking, and targeting logic

🧠 Open them up and take notes! Can you find examples of the tactics we listed above? Can you spot any new ideas worth stealing for your bot?

> Learning from others is how pros get ahead — don’t reinvent the tank!

# 💬 Discussion

* What was the most clever movement or behavior you saw in the example bots?
* Did any robots show off defense instead of offense?
* Would you rather be fast and dodgy, or slow and powerful?

Let’s share ideas together before we start coding tomorrow!
