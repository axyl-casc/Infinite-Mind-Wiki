## Capture a Screenshot

Use the Windows **Snipping Tool** to grab a clean shot of your bot during a battle:

1. Open Robocode and start a match so your robot is on screen.
2. Press `Win + Shift + S` to launch the Snipping Tool.
3. Drag to select the battle area you want to capture.
4. Release the mouse to copy the screenshot to your clipboard.
5. Paste (`Ctrl + V`) into Paint or your favorite editor and save the image.

A crisp screenshot looks great on your player card!
