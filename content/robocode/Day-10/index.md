> Day 10 closes out the Robocode lab with a **friendly tournament** and time to reflect.

## Overview

- Celebrate through a friendly competition.
- Showcase unique robot designs and strategies.
- Reflect on the journey using peer & self-assessment tools.

We'll run a [round-robin tournament](/robocode/tournament_format) where every student battles each other once. At the end, mark the top three finishers on each player's tank card with **1**, **2**, or **3**.
