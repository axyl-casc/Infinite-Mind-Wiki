> Kick off Day 5 with a friendly tournament.

## Overview

- Celebrate through a friendly competition.
- Showcase unique robot designs and strategies.

We'll run a [classic free-for-all tournament](/robocode/tournament_format) where every student battles together in the same arena. Mark the top three finishers on each player's tank card with **1**, **2**, or **3**.
