> Diving into **3 - Methods and Classes** ü§ñ

# Why Use Methods?

Methods package related statements so you can call them whenever you need. This keeps `run()` clean and focused.

```java
public void run() {
    initialize();
    while (true) {
        scanAndFire();
        moveAroundMap();
    }
}

public void initialize(){
    ...
}
public void scanAndFire(){
    ...
}
public void moveAroundMap(){
    ...
}
```

The modular code will be easier to add new behaviour to and will increase your bots efficiency.
