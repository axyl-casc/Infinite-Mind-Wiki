> Ready for **2 - Debugging with Patience** üòÄ

Debugging is about observing carefully and staying calm. Small steps help you understand what your robot is doing.

## Simple Techniques

- **Print messages** with `System.out.println` to trace actions.
- **Test often** so bugs appear sooner.
- **Check assumptions** by printing variable values.

When an error happens, breathe, read the message, and try one fix at a time. Kindness to yourself makes the process smoother.

## Example Flow

1. Run the robot and watch the console.
2. If something looks wrong, pause and add a print statement.
3. Test again and see if the output matches your expectations.

Patience and friendliness turn debugging into a chance to learn, not a chore.
