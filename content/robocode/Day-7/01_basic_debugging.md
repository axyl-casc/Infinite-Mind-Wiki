# üêû Using the Robocode Program to Debug

This class is about watching your robot **closely**. You‚Äôll run your bot in the Robocode program, observe what it does, and learn to fix problems step by step.

---

## üéØ Your Goal

You‚Äôll be improving and troubleshooting your own robot using real-time feedback. This is a **programming day**, so you'll test ideas and fix bugs by watching how your bot behaves in the arena.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Simple Techniques

Here are easy tools to help you debug:

* **Print messages** with `System.out.println()` ‚Äî show when actions happen.
* **Test often** ‚Äî run your robot after each small change.
* **Check assumptions** ‚Äî print out variables like energy, position, or direction.

```java
System.out.println("Energy: " + getEnergy());
System.out.println("Heading: " + getDirection());
```

> These messages appear in the terminal when your bot runs.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Control the Game Speed

The Robocode program includes tools to help you analyze each turn:

* Use the **TPS slider** to slow down the game.
* Use **Pause** and **Resume** to stop and start the match.
* Click **Next Turn** to move forward one tick at a time ‚Äî perfect for step-by-step analysis since the game is technically turn-based.

> Watching your robot frame-by-frame can reveal exactly where things go wrong.

---

## üîç Example Flow

1. Run your robot and **watch what it does**.
2. Use the TPS slider to slow things down if needed.
3. If something looks weird, **pause and add a print**.
4. Run again and check if your guess was right.
5. Make one small change. Test again.

> Stay curious. Fixing bugs is about being a **detective**.

---

## üí¨ If Something Breaks

* Read the error message slowly.
* See what line it talks about.
* Try changing one thing at a time.

```java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException...
```

> This means something wasn't set up. Print what you expected to be there.

## üí° Final Advice

Be kind to yourself. Everyone gets bugs. Debugging is **how** you learn. The more you observe, the better you'll build.
