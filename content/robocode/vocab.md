Java Concepts Glossary

## 1.1 Class

**Definition:** A blueprint for creating objects, containing methods and attributes.
**Example:**

```java
public class Vehicle {
    // Attributes and methods here
}
```

## 1.2 Object

**Definition:** An instance of a class.
**Example:**

```java
Vehicle myCar = new Vehicle();
```

## 1.3 Method

**Definition:** A function defined inside a class.
**Example:**

```java
public void drive() {
    // Method implementation
}
```

## 1.4 Constructor

**Definition:** A special method used to initialize objects.
**Example:**

```java
public Vehicle() {
    // Constructor code
}
```

## 1.5 Inheritance

**Definition:** A mechanism where one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.
**Example:**

```java
public class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Car class code
}
```

## 1.6 Interface

**Definition:** A template that can be applied to a class. Similar to a class, but with methods that have no implementation.
**Example:**

```java
public interface Drivable {
    void drive();
}
```

## 1.7 Encapsulation

**Definition:** Keeping the data (attributes) and the code (methods) safe from external interference.
**Example:**

```java
private int speed;

public int getSpeed() {
    return speed;
}
```

## 1.8 Polymorphism

**Definition:** A concept where one interface can be used for a general class of actions.
**Example:**

```java
Vehicle myVehicle = new Car();
```

## 1.9 Abstract Class

**Definition:** A class that cannot be instantiated. It can only be used as a superclass.
**Example:**

```java
public abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}
```

## 1.10 Static

**Definition:** Belongs to the class, rather than a specific instance. Used for methods and attributes.
**Example:**

```java
public class Vehicle {
    public static int numberOfWheels = 4;
}
```

## 1.11 Protected

**Definition:** The attribute or method is accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
**Example:**

```java
protected int speed;
```

## 1.12 Final

**Definition:** Used to declare constants or methods that cannot be overridden, or classes that cannot be subclassed.
**Example:**

```java
public final int MAX_SPEED = 120;
```

## 1.13 Public

**Definition:** Indicates that the method or attribute can be accessed from any other class.
**Example:**

```java
public void drive() {
    // Method implementation
}
```

## 1.14 Private

**Definition:** Restricts the visibility of a class member; only accessible within the class it is declared.
**Example:**

```java
private int fuel;
```

## 1.15 Variable

**Definition:** A container for storing data values. Variables in Java must have a specific data type.
**Example:**

```java
int number = 5;
```

## 1.16 Package

**Definition:** A namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in Java. Packages are used to avoid naming conflicts and to control access.
**Example:**

```java
package com.example.myapp;
```

## 1.17 Array

**Definition:** A container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
**Example:**

```java
int[] numbers = new int[10];
```

## 1.18 Exception

**Definition:** An event that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions. In Java, exceptions are objects that are thrown and caught.
**Example:**

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Code to handle the exception
}
```

## 1.19 Loop

**Definition:** A sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
**Example:**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Code to be repeated
}
```

## 1.20 Thread

**Definition:** A thread of execution in a program. The Java Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads running concurrently.
**Example:**

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Code to be executed in a new thread
    }
}
```

## 1.21 Attribute

**Definition:** A variable within a class, also known as a field or member.
**Example:**

```java
public class Vehicle {
    private int speed; // Attribute
}
```

## 1.22 Compiler

**Definition:** A tool that translates source code into executable code. In Java, the source code in `.java` files is compiled to bytecode in `.class` files.
**Example:** The Java compiler (`javac`) compiles Java source files into bytecode.

## 1.23 Bytecode

**Definition:** An intermediate code between source code and machine code, which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes.
**Example:** Java bytecode generated by the compiler is platform-independent and executed by the JVM.

## 1.24 Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

**Definition:** An abstract machine that enables a computer to run Java programs.
**Example:** The JVM reads and executes bytecode for Java applications.

## 1.25 Java Development Kit (JDK)

**Definition:** A software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development.
**Example:** The JDK must be installed to develop Java applications.

## 1.26 Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

**Definition:** A part of the Java Development Kit (JDK); it provides libraries, the JVM, and other components to run applications written in Java.
**Example:** The JRE is required to run Java applications on any platform.

## 1.27 Garbage Collection

**Definition:** A process by which the JVM reclaims memory from objects that are no longer in use, thus managing memory automatically.
**Example:** In Java, garbage collection helps in efficient memory management by deleting unused objects.

## 1.28 Truncation

**Definition:** Truncation refers to the process of shortening a number by removing digits after the decimal point, without rounding. In programming, this is commonly seen when converting a floating-point number to an integer.

**Example:**

```java
int x = (int) 5.89;  // x becomes 5
```

In this example, the decimal portion (`.89`) is discarded, and the value is truncated to `5`.

Truncation is useful when you need the whole number part of a value and want to ignore its fractional component.

## 1.29 Primitive Data Types

**Definition:** Basic data types built into Java that store simple values (not objects).
**Example:**

```java
int age = 25;          // Integer
double price = 9.99;   // Decimal number
boolean isActive = true; // True/false
char grade = 'A';      // Single character
```

## 1.30 String

**Definition:** A class representing a sequence of characters (text). Strings are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
**Example:**

```java
String name = "Alice";
```

## 1.31 Conditional Statement

**Definition:** Code structure that executes different actions based on whether a condition is true/false.
**Example:**

```java
if (temperature > 30) {
    System.out.println("Hot day!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Pleasant day.");
}
```

## 1.32 Import Statement

**Definition:** Directive to include external classes/packages in your code.
**Example:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Allows using the Scanner class
```

## 1.33 Null

**Definition:** A special value indicating the absence of an object reference (no object assigned).
**Example:**

```java
String message = null; // No string object exists
```

## 1.34 Overloading

**Definition:** Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
**Example:**

```java
public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
public double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
```

## 1.35 Main Method

**Definition:** The entry point where Java starts executing a program. Required in every executable Java application.
**Example:**

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Program started!");
}
```

## 1.36 Debugging

**Definition:** The process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in code.
**Example:** Using breakpoints in an IDE to pause execution and inspect variables.

## 1.37 Algorithm

**Definition:** A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a computation.
**Example:** A recipe for sorting a list of numbers.

## 1.38 IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

**Definition:** Software that combines code editing, debugging, and build tools in one interface.
**Example:** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions.

## 1.39 Syntax

**Definition:** The set of rules that define correctly structured code in a programming language.
**Example:** Semicolons (;) ending statements in Java.

## 1.40 Return Statement

**Definition:** Ends a method's execution and optionally sends a result back to the caller.
**Example:**

```java
int square(int x) {
    return x * x; // Sends result back
}
```
