> Let's explore **3 - Ownership & Naming** ü§ñ

# Code Ownership

Give each method a single job. When every method clearly owns its task, bugs are easier to track down.

# Meaningful Names

Choose descriptive names for classes and methods so teammates instantly know what they do.

```java
public class RadarController {
    public void sweep() {
        turnRadarRight(360);
    }
}
```

Good naming leads to readable code that others can maintain.
