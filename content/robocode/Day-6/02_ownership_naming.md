> Let's explore **3 - Ownership & Naming** ü§ñ

# üß† Code Ownership

Good code is organized code. Give each method a **single job**. When every method clearly owns its task, bugs are easier to track down and your code is easier to read.

```java
// ‚ùå Don't do too much in one method
public void onScannedBot(ScannedBotEvent e) {
    fire(2);
    back(100);
    turnLeft(90);
}

// ‚úÖ Break it up
public void onScannedBot(ScannedBotEvent e) {
    double direction = e.getDirection();

    attackEnemy(direction);
    retreatFromEnemy(direction);
}

private void attackEnemy(double direction) {
    fire(2);
}

private void retreatFromEnemy(double direction) {
    back(100);
    turnLeft(90);
}
```

> Each method has a clear, focused job.

## üîÅ Sharing Information Between Methods

You can pass **values between methods using parameters**. This helps keep your logic clean and avoids using global state unless necessary.

```java
public void onScannedBot(ScannedBotEvent e) {
    double enemy_x = e.getX();
    double enemy_y = e.getY();

    aimAt(enemy_x, enemy_y);
}

private void aimAt(double x, double y) {
    // Use x and y to point the gun or radar
}
```

> Pass only the values the function needs.

---

# ‚úçÔ∏è Meaningful Names

Use **camelCase** for method names, and **snake\_case** for variables.

```java
// camelCase for methods
private void turnToEnemy() {
    // ...
}

// snake_case for variables
double enemy_distance = 180;
int bullet_count = 3;
```

> Your code should be readable like a story.
