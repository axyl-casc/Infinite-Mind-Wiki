# Breaking Up `run()`

Large blocks of code quickly become messy. Helper methods let you name a routine and reuse it.

```java
private void scanAndFire() {
    turnRadarRight(360);
    if (getGunHeat() == 0) {
        fire(1);
    }
}
```

Call `scanAndFire()` whenever your robot should look for opponents. This keeps the main loop short and readable.
