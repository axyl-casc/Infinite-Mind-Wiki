# Why Use Methods?

Methods package related statements so you can call them whenever you need. This keeps `run()` clean and focused.

```java
public void run() {
    initialize();
    while (true) {
        scanAndFire();
    }
}

private void initialize() {
    setAdjustGunForRobotTurn(true);
}
```

Classes group both data and behavior. Every robot you create extends `AdvancedRobot` and defines its own methods.

```java
public class HelperBot extends AdvancedRobot {
    // run() and event handlers live here
}
```
