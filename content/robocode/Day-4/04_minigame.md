# üéÆ Try the PlayerBot! (WASD + Q/E + Space)

Before you start coding your own AI tank, it's important to understand how Robocode movement and firing actually *feel*. To help you do that, we‚Äôve built a special tank that YOU can drive around!

## üß† What is PlayerBot?

PlayerBot is a manually-controlled robot that you can move using your keyboard. It‚Äôs a great way to get a sense of how turning, moving, and firing bullets works in the arena.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Before you can play, you need to get everything running:

1. **Download the PlayerBot `.jar` file**

   * Your instructor will give you the file. Save it somewhere easy to find.

2. **Launch the Robocode Local Server**

   * Run the main Robocode Tank Royale launcher.
   * Start the **Local Server** from the launcher.

3. **Open the `server.properties` file**

   * This file is found inside the Robocode server folder.
   * Look for the `bots-secrets` value. Copy the secret key.

4. **Run PlayerBot**

   * Double-click or run the `PlayerBot.jar` file.
   * When it asks for a secret, paste the `bots-secrets` value you copied.
   * Now the PlayerBot should connect and appear in the battle!
