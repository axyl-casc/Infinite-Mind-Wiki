# Working with ScannedRobotEvent

`ScannedRobotEvent` is a key event in Robocode, fired automatically whenever your robot's radar detects another robot. Almost every robot should override this method to respond to detected opponents.

## `onScannedRobot(ScannedRobotEvent event)`

### What it Does

This method is called when your robot sees another robot ‚Äî i.e., when your radar scan "hits" another robot. You must override this method if you want your robot to respond to nearby enemies.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The radar only detects robots within a specific range, defined by `Rules.RADAR_SCAN_RADIUS`, which is **1200 pixels**.

The **bearing** you receive is *relative* to your robot's current heading, **not** an absolute angle.

### Method Signature

```java
public void onScannedRobot(ScannedRobotEvent event)
```

### Parameters

* `event`: An instance of `ScannedRobotEvent` containing data about the scanned robot.

### Event Data Includes:

* `getDistance()`: Distance to the scanned robot.
* `getBearing()`: Relative angle to the robot.
* `getHeading()`: Absolute heading of the enemy.
* `getVelocity()`: How fast the enemy is moving.
* `getEnergy()`: Remaining energy of the opponent.
* `getName()`: The name of the robot.

### Example:

```java
public void onScannedRobot(ScannedRobotEvent event) {
    System.out.println("Enemy detected at: " + event.getDistance() + " pixels");

    // Basic targeting logic
    if (event.getDistance() < 100) {
        fire(3);  // Strong shot at close range
    } else {
        fire(1);  // Weaker shot at long range
    }
}
```

## Firing Assistance in Robocode

Robocode assists **basic robots** with targeting under certain conditions:

If:

1. The radar and gun are aligned (and were aligned last turn),
2. The event is current,
3. `fire()` is called before any other movement or turn actions,

Then:

* Your bullet will automatically be aimed at the scanned robot. This can make your robot more accurate without manually calculating angles.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: AdvancedRobots **do not** get this assistance. You must manually calculate angles and positions if you are using an `AdvancedRobot`.

### Summary:

* Override `onScannedRobot` to react to enemies.
* Use the data in `ScannedRobotEvent` to decide when and how to fire.
* Understand the game‚Äôs assisted aiming system to optimize shot timing.
