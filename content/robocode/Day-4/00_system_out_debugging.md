# Using System.out.println

Robocode runs your robot inside a Java VM, so the standard way to print messages is with `System.out.println`. These messages show up in the Robocode console window.

```java
System.out.println("Scanning...");
```

Use prints like this inside your event handlers to see when they trigger and what values you receive. It's a simple but powerful tool for understanding your robot's behavior.
