# Robocode 1 vs 1 Tournament

At the end of the week we host a point-based tournament. We use a simple **MacMahon** style system so everyone plays several rounds and earns points for each win. Every student enters their custom robot and battles the instructor's bot.

## Bracket

```
Quarterfinals  Semifinals   Final
A ------------
               \            
B ------------  \          
                 \------
C ------------   /      \__ Champion
               /          
D ------------ /          
```

The bracket illustrates one possible pairing for the first round. After each round we update the scores and pair competitors with similar points until a final ranking emerges.

## Rules

- Matches are **1 vs 1**.
- Each round is the best of three battles.
- The instructor's bot also competes. Can you defeat it?

Good luck, and may the best code win!
