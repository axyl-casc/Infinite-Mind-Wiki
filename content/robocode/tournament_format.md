> Buckle up for **Tournament Format** ðŸ¤–
# Robocode Free-for-All Tournament

At the end of the week, we host a tournament using Robocode's **Classic** mode. Every student loads their custom robot into the same arena and battles simultaneously in a free-for-all showdown.

## Format

* **Classic Mode:** All robots fight at once.
* Play a **set of battles** (e.g., best of three) to smooth out randomness.
* Players earn **points for each battle win**.
* The instructor's bot joins the chaos. Can you defeat it?

After all battles, bots are ranked by total points. Ties may be broken with an extra battle.

## Rules

* Battles use Robocode's **classic free-for-all** settings.
* Last robot standing wins the battle.
* Total points determine final standings.

Good luck, and may the best code win!
