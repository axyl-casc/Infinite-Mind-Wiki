# Robocode 1 vs 1 Tournament

At the end of the week, we host a **round-robin** style tournament where every student competes against every other student. Each participant enters their custom robot, and matches are played to determine a final leaderboard.

## Format

* **Round Robin:** Every robot battles every other robot once.
* Matches are **1 vs 1**.
* Each match consists of a **best of three** battles.
* Players earn **1 point per match win**.
* The instructor's bot also competes in the round robin. Can you defeat it?

At the end of all rounds, the bots are ranked by total points. Ties may be broken using head-to-head results or an extra tie-breaker match.

## Example Schedule

| Match | Competitors             |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | Student A vs B          |
| 2     | Student A vs C          |
| 3     | Student B vs C          |
| 4     | Student A vs Instructor |
| 5     | Student B vs Instructor |
| 6     | Student C vs Instructor |

This continues until all matchups have been played.

## Rules

* Matches are **1 vs 1**.
* Each round is the **best of three** battles.
* Total points determine final standings.

Good luck, and may the best code win!
