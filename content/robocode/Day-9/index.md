## Lesson Requirements

* Bring your working robot code and design notes from **Day 8**

* Review the [Robocode BaseBot API JavaDocs](/robocode/Day-9/02_robocode_javadocs)

## Lesson Outcomes

* Implement movement patterns like sweeping left/right
* Showcase your robot and gather feedback from mentors
* Iterate based on what you learn from other teams

> Today is a **full build day**. Team up with mentors and keep iterating on your robot.

## Agenda

- **Full build day with mentors** – pair up and keep coding.
- **Encourage cascade mentorship** – experienced students help newer ones.
- **Invite community check-ins and progress showcases** – show off your bots.

This day we look at each other's projects and discuss ideas one by one. We'll focus on programming the robot.
