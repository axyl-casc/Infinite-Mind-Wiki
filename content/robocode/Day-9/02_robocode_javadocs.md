JavaDocs are the official documentation generated from Java source code comments. They describe classes, methods, and fields so developers can understand how to use a library or API.

## BaseBot API

Robocode Tank Royale provides a `BaseBot` class that your robot extends. Its JavaDocs detail everything your bot can do, including movement, event handling, and utilities. Review the [BaseBot API documentation](https://robocode-dev.github.io/tank-royale/api/java/dev/robocode/tankroyale/botapi/BaseBot.html) while developing your robot.

Use these JavaDocs as a reference when implementing features in your robot.
