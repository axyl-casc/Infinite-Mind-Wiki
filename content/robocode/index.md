# Java Robocode Course Outline

Welcome to the Java **Robocode** course! This ten-day camp teaches core programming concepts through the fun and engaging platform of Robocode. Each of the first eight days focuses on a specific Java concept applied through robot design and battle mechanics. The final two days are dedicated to a capstone project and tournament.

---

## Day 1 – Setting Up Java

* Install Java (JDK) and verify with command-line or IDE.
* Run a simple `HelloWorld` program.
* Install Robocode and explore the interface.
* Overview of how Robocode relates to Java.

## Day 2 – Introducing Robocode

* Create a basic robot class.
* Compile and run against built-in sample robots.
* Understand robot folder structure and build process.
* Explore robot API basics: `run`, `ahead`, `turnGunRight`, etc.

## Day 3 – Java Variables in a Robot

* Explore local vs instance variables.
* Use variables to store battle state (e.g., energy, direction).
* Practice using `int`, `double`, and `String` in robot logic.
* Use variables to drive robot decisions or track performance.

## Day 4 – Input, Output, and Events

* Understand event-based programming in Robocode.
* Work with `ScannedRobotEvent`, `HitByBulletEvent`, etc.
* Use `System.out.println` for debugging.
* Process input data to change robot behavior.

## Day 5 – Conditionals and Loops

* Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to make decisions.
* Implement `while` loops for main robot behavior.
* Add `for` loops for patterns and repeating actions.
* Program reactionary logic to real-time battle input.

## Day 6 – Classes and Methods

* Organize code using custom methods.
* Learn how `AdvancedRobot` enables more complex behaviors.
* Split logic into helper methods (e.g., `fireIfTargetLocked()`).
* Introduce private vs public methods and scope rules.

## Day 7 – Error Handling

* Discuss common Robocode errors and how to fix them.
* Practice using `try/catch` blocks.
* Introduce stack traces and debugging techniques.

## Day 8 – Strategy, UML, & Battle Design

* Review advanced strategies and Robocode tactics.
* Discuss movement patterns and targeting.
* Refactor your robot for better performance.
* Sketch a UML diagram of your robot's structure.
* Prepare for the final project.

## Day 9 – Final Project Build Day

* Students design and build their own custom robot.
* Apply Java skills in a strategic combat bot.
* Debug, optimize, and test designs.

## Day 10 – Showcase & Tournament

* Host a class tournament.
* Reflect on robot design, coding style, and strategy.
* Provide peer feedback and discuss improvement ideas.
