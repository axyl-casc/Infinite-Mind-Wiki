# 🤖 Java Robocode Course Outline

Welcome to the Java **Robocode** course! This ten-day coding camp teaches core programming concepts through the fun and fast-paced world of **robot battles** ⚔️. Each day combines theory with hands-on coding, letting students **design, build, and battle** their own virtual robots in Robocode!

Students who have taken an introductory programming course in a similar, object-oriented language (like Python, C++, or JavaScript) ✨ may choose to start directly with **Week 2**.

> Let's tackle **Robocode Lab** 🤖

## ✨ Week 1 (Days 1–5): Java Fundamentals & Robocode Basics

The first week builds a strong foundation in Java programming while introducing Robocode step-by-step. Each day covers an essential concept that is immediately applied to robot design. By the end of the week, students will:

* ⚙️ Set up Java and the Robocode platform
* ✍️ Write Java code using variables, conditions, and loops
* 🤖 Build their first robot and make it move and fire
* 📃 Use output tools like `System.out.println` to debug

Perfect for students with **little or no programming experience**, this week gets everyone battle-ready!

## 🥷 Week 2 (Days 6–10): AI Strategies & Robocode Implementation

The second week focuses on making robots **smarter, faster, and more strategic** 🧠. Students will level up their Java knowledge and apply **AI concepts** to Robocode's event system. Topics include:

* 🕵️‍♂️ Creating algorithms for scanning, dodging, and targeting
* ⚡ Managing robot energy and state
* 🧐 Predictive movement and reaction logic
* 🖋️ Sketching UML diagrams for planning behavior

Students finish with a **capstone project**: designing a battle-ready robot to enter in our **Robocode tournament** 🏆.
