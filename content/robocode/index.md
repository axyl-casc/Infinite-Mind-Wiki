# 🤖 Java Robocode Course

Welcome to the Java **Robocode** course! This ten-day creative coding journey blends hands-on learning, story-building, and game design as students **build, test, and battle** their own virtual robots. In this space, every learner’s story matters — we create community, celebrate curiosity, and embrace challenges together.

## 🌱 Week 1 (Days 1–5): Foundations & First Robots

A gentle, supportive start for all learners. This week emphasizes **accessibility**, **debugging through discovery**, and **scaffolded growth**.

Students will:

- 💻 Set up Java and Robocode using multiple entry points
- ✍️ Write simple programs with variables, loops, and conditions
- ⚙️ Build and move their first robot — safely and creatively
- 📃 Practice `System.out.println` debugging as a reflection tool

This week fosters **relationships**, **confidence**, and a sense of **belonging** through shared coding milestones.

## 🤝 Week 2 (Days 6–10): Smarter Bots, Stronger Voices

Students deepen their understanding of Java and design **AI-driven robot behavior**, applying **strategy and planning**.

They will:

- 🎯 Create scanning and dodging logic
- 🧠 Learn to manage robot energy/state
- ✏️ Sketch robot behavior using flowcharts

Finale: A **Robocode tournament** with a focus on **kindness**, **peer feedback**, and **shared joy**.
