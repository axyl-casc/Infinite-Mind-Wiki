# Java Robocode Course Outline

Welcome to the Java **Robocode** course! This ten-day camp teaches core programming concepts through the fun and engaging platform of Robocode. Each day combines theory and hands-on coding experience, letting students design, build, and battle their own virtual robots. Students who have taken an introductory programming course in a similar, object-oriented language such as Python, C++, or JavaScript may also choose to start directly with Week 2.

### Week 1 (Days 1–5): Java Fundamentals & Robocode Basics

The first week focuses on foundational Java programming and getting comfortable with Robocode. Each day introduces a core Java topic and immediately applies it in the context of robot programming. By the end of the week, students will understand how to:

* Set up a Java environment and the Robocode platform
* Write basic Java programs with variables, conditions, and loops
* Create their first robot, explore robot events, and control movement and firing
* Use output and debugging tools like `System.out.println`

This week builds essential skills that will serve as the backbone for more advanced robot behavior. It is ideal for students with little to no programming background. However, students who already have experience with Java or another programming language can skip ahead to Week 2.

### Week 2 (Days 6–10): AI Strategies & Robocode Implementation

The second week dives deeper into Robocode and artificial intelligence concepts. Students will learn to make their robots smarter, more reactive, and more strategic by using Java constructs and Robocode's event-driven model. Key topics include:

* Writing custom algorithms for opponent detection, dodging, and targeting
* Managing robot state and optimizing energy usage
* Implementing simple forms of machine logic and predictive movement
* Using UML diagrams to plan robot behavior and structure

By the end of the course, students will complete a **capstone project**: designing an advanced robot to compete in a final-day **Robocode tournament**.

This structure ensures students learn real-world programming while having fun and developing problem-solving and strategic thinking skills.

## Day 1 – Setting Up Java

* Install Java (JDK) and verify with command-line or IDE.
* Run a simple `HelloWorld` program.
* Install Robocode and explore the interface.
* Overview of how Robocode relates to Java.

## Day 2 – Introducing Robocode

* Create a basic robot class.
* Compile and run against built-in sample robots.
* Understand robot folder structure and build process.
* Explore robot API basics: `run`, `ahead`, `turnGunRight`, etc.

## Day 3 – Java Variables in a Robot

* Explore local vs instance variables.
* Use variables to store battle state (e.g., energy, direction).
* Practice using `int`, `double`, and `String` in robot logic.
* Use variables to drive robot decisions or track performance.

## Day 4 – Input, Output, and Events

* Understand event-based programming in Robocode.
* Work with `ScannedRobotEvent`, `HitByBulletEvent`, etc.
* Use `System.out.println` for debugging.
* Process input data to change robot behavior.

## Day 5 – Conditionals and Loops

* Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to make decisions.
* Implement `while` loops for main robot behavior.
* Add `for` loops for patterns and repeating actions.
* Program reactionary logic to real-time battle input.

## Day 6 – Classes and Methods

* Organize code using custom methods.
* Learn how `AdvancedRobot` enables more complex behaviors.
* Split logic into helper methods (e.g., `fireIfTargetLocked()`).
* Introduce private vs public methods and scope rules.

## Day 7 – Error Handling

* Discuss common Robocode errors and how to fix them.
* Practice using `try/catch` blocks.
* Introduce stack traces and debugging techniques.

## Day 8 – Strategy, UML, & Battle Design

* Review advanced strategies and Robocode tactics.
* Discuss movement patterns and targeting.
* Refactor your robot for better performance.
* Sketch a UML diagram of your robot's structure.
* Prepare for the final project.

## Day 9 – Final Project Build Day

* Students design and build their own custom robot.
* Apply Java skills in a strategic combat bot.
* Debug, optimize, and test designs.

## Day 10 – Showcase & Tournament

* Host a class tournament.
* Reflect on robot design, coding style, and strategy.
* Provide peer feedback and discuss improvement ideas.
