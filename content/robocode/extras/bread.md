# Java Programming: Bread‑Making 🍞🤖

| Bakery Stage                    | Java + Robocode Stage                                | What’s Happening                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Gather & Mix Ingredients** | **Write Code (`*.java`)**                            | You combine flour, water, yeast, and salt into dough. Likewise, you gather ideas, classes, and methods, writing them into readable source files (e.g., `TankBot.java`).                                        |
| **2. Knead & Proof**            | **Static Analysis / Try Small Battles**              | Working the dough builds structure; letting it rise exposes weak spots. Running linters and launching quick Robocode test rounds “kneads” your code, revealing logic bugs while the design has room to expand. |
| **3. Bake**                     | **Compile with `javac` (include Robocode API jars)** | Heat transforms raw dough into bread. The Java compiler turns human‑readable code plus the Robocode API (`robocode-tankroyale-bot-api.jar`) into JVM‑ready bytecode (`*.class`).                               |
| **4. Cool & Slice**             | **Bundle Support Files (bot descriptor, images)**    | Fresh bread needs a moment before slicing. After compilation, you gather extra assets: `TankBot.json`, team logos, sounds—ensuring each slice (class) is served with the right toppings.                       |
| **5. Bag or Jar the Loaf**      | **Create the Bot JAR (`jar cf TankBot.jar …`)**      | You pop the loaf in a bag so it stays fresh. You seal compiled classes **and** the descriptor into a single `TankBot.jar`, ready for any Robocode arena.                                                       |
| **6. Ship to Friends / Market** | **Deploy to Battle**                                 | Deliver bread to neighbors or the bakery shelf. You copy the JAR to your Robocode bots folder or share it online, so anyone with the game can enjoy your fresh‑baked bot.                                      |

> **Key Takeaway:** Treat your Robocode bot like artisanal bread — the right ingredients, gentle kneading, and proper heat yield a tasty, battle‑ready result.
