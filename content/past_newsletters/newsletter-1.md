  * Clearly communicate session lengths in promotions
* **Newsletter snippet:**

## 3. Sustainability Lab in Minecraft Java

VG also suggests a biweekly newsletter format rotating course spotlights, student showcases and upcoming sessions. The goal is to repurpose our videos and drive brand awareness for Infinite Mind.

Please share any feedback or questions so we can refine future issues.
