### Fuel Cards

Move one or both ships 3–5 spaces depending on value. Only one fuel card may be used per turn. Without fuel, you may use free **auxiliary power** to move two spaces.

---

### Durriken Cards

Represent mercenary forces from the outer worlds. Deploy a Durriken via Teleprism to sabotage rival trade routes. When it lands, it destroys all connected Freight Routes except those on reinforced paths. Durrikens move only with auxiliary power.

---

### Trap Cards

Pay two 4-fuel cards to draw a Trap card. Mines are placed face down with a planet card. When another pilot lands there, the mine explodes and sends them back to their home planet.

---

### Arkstorm

This cataclysmic card wipes out every Freight Route at once except for reinforced routes.

---

### The Gambit

At the start of your turn draw three face-down cards:

1. Flip the first card and guess if the second is higher or lower.
2. Flip the second card. If wrong, keep the first and discard the rest. If right, you may stop and keep both or guess on card three.
3. Flip the third card if you guessed again. If correct, keep all three; otherwise discard them.

---

### Dogfights

When two pilots meet on the same planet or space, each chooses two non-fuel cards. The higher total wins and stays; the loser returns home. On a tie, start the Durriken staring contest—first to blink loses. Discard used cards afterward.

---

### Freighter Routes

- **Quickroute Bonus** – Completed quickroutes cost one fuel per ship to traverse.
- **Reinforced Routes** – Routes on yellow sideways paths are immune to the Arkstorm and Durriken destruction.

---

### Teleprism

Any time you land on or cross a coloured triangle in the centre of the board, roll the white pip die (1–6) for the sector and the numbered die (1–6) for the planet where your ship will emerge.
