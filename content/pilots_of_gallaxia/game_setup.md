## Objective

Rescue your stranded scientist by constructing trade route warps with **Freight Route sticks** and using mercenary Durriken to hamper rivals. Return the scientist to your home planet to win.

## Components

- **Freight Route sticks** – Build trade route warps between planets.
- **Scientist token** – Rescue this to win.
- **Cards** – Planet, fuel, Durriken and the Arkstorm.
- **Trap cards** – Mines and other hazards.

Each player begins with two ships, twenty Freight Route sticks and six Trap cards of their colour.

## Setup

1. Choose a colour and place both ships on the home planet in that sector.
2. Put your scientist on planet #4 in the opposite sector.
3. Deal each pilot five cards, plus their sticks and Trap cards.
4. Shuffle the Arkstorm card back into the deck once cards are dealt.

## Starting Play

Roll a die. The highest roller begins, then play moves clockwise. The first player immediately draws a **Gambit**.
