Far-off **Gallaxia** is filled with adventure and danger. Durriken invaders strive to rule, but glowing **Star Prisms** guard the worlds while daring Gallaxian pilots hold the line. The uneasy alliance between sectors is fraying—each suspects the others of plotting to free their "peace hostage" scientist first.

On the battle-hardened outer planets, mercenary Durriken are hired to sabotage routes and fight for the highest bidder. As your sector's top pilot, you must build trade route warps and deploy these mercenaries to reach your scientist, stranded after a failed **Teleprism** experiment. Recovering them before your rivals ensures control of their research—and victory.
